### **Set 1: Short Theory Questions**

1. **Difference Between Simple Reflex Agents and Model-Based Reflex Agents**:  
   - **Simple Reflex Agents**:  
     These operate based solely on the current percept. They do not consider the history or future consequences.  
     Example: A thermostat turning the heater on/off based on the current temperature.  
     - Limitation: Cannot handle environments requiring memory or history.
   - **Model-Based Reflex Agents**:  
     These use an internal model of the environment to keep track of unobservable states and make decisions.  
     Example: A robotic vacuum using a map of the house to decide the next move.  
     - Advantage: Suitable for partially observable environments.

2. **Key Challenges in Hill Climbing Search Algorithms**:  
   - **Local Maxima**: The algorithm can get stuck at a peak that is not the global maximum.  
   - **Plateaus**: Flat regions with no gradient make it hard to determine the direction.  
   - **Ridges**: Narrow regions that require specific steps to navigate effectively.  
   - **Solution**: Use variants like simulated annealing or random restarts to overcome these challenges.

3. **Components of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:  
   - **Input Layer**: Accepts inputs (features) from the dataset.  
   - **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations and transformations through neurons with activation functions.  
   - **Output Layer**: Produces the final result (e.g., classification, regression).  
   **Applications**: Image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems.

### **Set 2: Short Theory Questions**

1. **Turing Test and Its Significance**:  
   - The **Turing Test**, proposed by Alan Turing, evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.  
   - **Significance**: If a machine passes the test, it demonstrates a form of intelligence, bridging the gap between human and artificial cognition.

2. **PEAS Framework**:  
   - **Performance Measure**: Defines the success criteria (e.g., accuracy).  
   - **Environment**: The external conditions the agent interacts with (e.g., road traffic for a self-driving car).  
   - **Actuators**: Components that perform actions (e.g., wheels, motors).  
   - **Sensors**: Devices that gather information (e.g., cameras, LIDAR).  
     Example:  
     - **Agent**: Self-driving car.  
     - **Performance Measure**: Minimize travel time, ensure safety.  
     - **Environment**: Roads, traffic signals.  
     - **Actuators**: Steering, brakes.  
     - **Sensors**: Cameras, radar.

3. **Comparison of BFS and DFS**:  
   - **BFS**: Explores nodes level by level. Suitable for finding the shortest path.  
     - Time Complexity: \(O(b^d)\).  
   - **DFS**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
     - Space Complexity: \(O(bd)\).  
   - **Key Difference**: BFS uses a queue and requires more memory; DFS uses a stack and is more memory efficient.

### **Set 3: Short Theory Questions**

1. **Chinese Room Argument**:  
   - Proposed by John Searle, it argues that AI can simulate understanding but lacks true cognition.  
     Example: A person inside a room following instructions to manipulate Chinese symbols without understanding the language.  
   - **Implications**: Challenges the idea that computational processes equate to human understanding.

2. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic Environments**:  
   - **Deterministic**: Actions have predictable outcomes.  
     Example: Chess.  
   - **Stochastic**: Outcomes involve randomness.  
     Example: Poker, where card draws are uncertain.

3. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:  
   - An optimization technique in the minimax algorithm for game-playing. It skips evaluating parts of the search tree that won't affect the final decision.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Reduces computation time.  
     - Explores fewer nodes.

### **Set 4: Short Theory Questions**

1. **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning**:  
   - **Supervised**: Learns from labeled data.  
     Example: Spam email classification.  
   - **Unsupervised**: Learns patterns from unlabeled data.  
     Example: Customer segmentation.  
   - **Reinforcement**: Learns through trial and error using rewards.  
     Example: Teaching a robot to walk.

2. **Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining**:  
   - **Forward Chaining**: Starts with known facts and applies rules to derive conclusions.  
     Example: Medical diagnosis based on symptoms.  
   - **Backward Chaining**: Starts with a goal and works backward to verify if facts support it.  
     Example: Deductive reasoning in theorem proving.

3. **Fuzzy Logic and Its Applications**:  
   - **Concept**: Deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than precise.  
   - **Application**:  
     - Washing machines determining water levels based on dirtiness.  
     - Control systems for temperature regulation.
